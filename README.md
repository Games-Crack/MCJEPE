A Minecraft Java editon Portable Laucher,
I Know there other launchers out there but this one is mine!
Ive compiled The batchfile with "Bat To Exe Converter" (V:1.5) By Fatih Kodak.
.
The Source Code is In The Exe You can decompile it with this command:
mcJEPE.exe -d
then select the dir to move the batch file

You can trust me its not a virus some antiviruses will flagg this exe because it executes commands (that are basicly harmless) some trojans do that too thats why the AVs coud flagg it!
if you have Security concerns use The Batchfile
